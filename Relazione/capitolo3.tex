\chapter {Analysis on players data}

The previous phases of data cleaning resulted in a dataset of 917 players with 114 votes each.
Analysis are performed on different abstraction levels.
At the beginning, high-level evaluations are made to discover stats on number of played matches (mean, min, max etc.); analysis on number of played matches are reported in figure \ref{fig:countMatch}.

  \label{fig:countMatch}
\end{figure}

Similarly, a fine grained analysis has been made by grouping players per role, as shown in figure \ref{fig:countMatchPerRole}, but no relevant differences have been found.

\section{Data correlation}

The task goal is discovering, if present, seasonality on players' votes.
\\
In order to achieve such a target, Pearson Correlation Index has been used, for single player and for role both.
\\
Empirical tests show that no relevant seasonality can be detected.
\\
Figure \ref{fig:playereg} reports data on an example player.

\end{figure}

\section{Normality test}

Normalty test were made on both votes and fantavotes to determine if the two datasets could be modeled by a normal distribution.
qq-plot and histograms of votes showed a correlation with the normal distribution for almost all players  (Figure \ref{fig:hist_votes} and Figure \ref{fig:qqplot_votes})
The same can't be said for the fantavotes dataset (Figure \ref{fig:hist_fantavotes} and Figure \ref{fig:qqplot_fantavotes})
