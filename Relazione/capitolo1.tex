\chapter {Data retrival and cleaning}

\section{Data retrival}
Votes for each season since 05/06 are stored on ''Gazzetta dello Sport" website (fantapiu3.com).
In order to create the dataset, we exploited an existing page crawler realized for a previous project.
\\
Firstly, we made code refactoring on such project so we could start from a well laid out hard core.
\\
Then, we started by improving the application because the existing code would retrieve votes just for one season; we extended the retrival to more season, in particular we used 3 season but that's not a constraint since the program is parametric on number of seasons. 
This parameter has been set to 3 since we evaluated that football market is very dynamic and just few players keep playing in ''Serie A" for years;
some trials have been made and 3 resulted a good compromise.
\\
In the end, votes were saved on external file using CSV standard format; two files are created respectively for votes and fantavotes.
\\
A third dataset storing bonuses is created too from the existing two by a simple difference $fantavote - vote$.

\section{Data cleaning}  

Few checks have been made on categorical attributes in order to fix wrong values (e.g. ''OKONKWOO" resulting on playing in not existing role).
\\
Then, all players that did not play at least one match are dropped since no analysis can be performed with no vote at all.
